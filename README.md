#  Library Management System in C++

This project implements a basic **Library Management System** in **C++**, enabling functionality such as:

- Managing multiple libraries
- Managing books and book types
- Borrowing and returning books
- Finding books by type or availability
- Searching for nearest libraries with a specific book

##  Features

-  Add books to libraries
-  Register new members
-  Borrow and return books (with limitations)

##  Class Structure

### `Publisher`

- Can borrow up to 5 books at a time.
- Maintains a list of borrowed books per library.

### `Library`

- Supports:
  - Adding books
  - Retrieving books by name or type
  - Showing book info
  - Checking if a book exists

### `LibrariesHandler`
- Handles all libraries and members.
- Global operations like:
  - Creating libraries
  - Adding books
  - Borrowing and returning books
  - Filtering books
  - Finding nearest libraries with available books

##  How to Run

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler such as `g++`:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o library
